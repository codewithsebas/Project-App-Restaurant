# Project App Travel #2

JavaScript is a very popular and versatile programming language that is widely used in web development. It supports a wide range of platforms and devices, and is a good choice for projects involving data manipulation and user interaction.

This project was developed in 8 hours and a half, thanks to a tutorial on YouTube, content creator and FullStack programmer, Vetriel Ravi thanks to him I was able to make this great project called App Travel, I hope it will be useful for future projects, or so you can improve your knowledge in React Native!
